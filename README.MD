#### Variations on arrays
- [Array2D](src/main/resources/Array2D.md). A two-dimensional array with fixed dimensions. Useful for board games.
- [SortedArray](src/main/resources/SortedArray.md). An array that is always sorted.

#### Queues
- [Stack](src/main/resources/Stack.md). Last-in, first-out!
- [Queue](src/main/resources/Queue.md). First-in, first-out!

#### Trees
- [Heap](src/main/resources/Heap.md). A complete binary tree stored in an array, so it doesn't use pointers. Makes a great priority queue.
- [Binary Search Tree (BST)](src/main/resources/BinarySearchTree.md). A binary tree that orders its nodes in a way that allows for fast queries.
